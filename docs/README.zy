# Zyren Programming Language Documentation

## Introduction
Zyren is a versatile programming language designed to be used for a wide range of applications, including operating systems, web browsers, AI systems, and websites. This documentation provides an overview of the language features and how to use Zyren for different types of applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with Zyren, you need to set up the development environment and understand the basic syntax and features of the language.

### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Install Zyren Compiler**: Follow the instructions in the `Zyren/build.sh` script to install the Zyren compiler.
2. **Create a New Project**: Use the Zyren compiler to create a new project directory and initialize the project files.

### Basic Syntax
Zyren uses a simple and intuitive syntax. Here are some basic examples:

```zy
# Basic arithmetic operations
fn add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b;
}

# String manipulation
fn concatenate(str1: String, str2: String) -> String {
    return str1 + str2;
}

# Control structures
fn if_else(condition: Bool, true_block: Function, false_block: Function) {
    if condition {
        true_block();
    } else {
        false_block();
    }
}
```

## Core Features
Zyren includes a set of core features that make it suitable for various types of applications.

### Memory Management
Zyren provides robust memory management features, including initialization, allocation, and deallocation of memory.

```zy
# Initialize memory management
fn init_memory_management() {
    // Implementation for initializing memory management
}

# Allocate memory
fn allocate_memory(size: Size) -> Pointer {
    // Implementation for allocating memory
}

# Free memory
fn free_memory(ptr: Pointer) {
    // Implementation for freeing memory
}
```

### Process Scheduling
Zyren includes process scheduling features to manage multiple processes efficiently.

```zy
# Add process
fn add_process(pid: Int, entry_point: Function, priority: Int) {
    // Implementation for adding process
}

# Set process state
fn set_process_state(pid: Int, state: ProcessState) {
    // Implementation for setting process state
}
```

### Interrupt Handling
Zyren provides interrupt handling features to manage hardware interrupts efficiently.

```zy
# Initialize interrupts
fn init_interrupts() {
    // Implementation for initializing interrupts
}

# Handle interrupt
fn handle_interrupt(interrupt_number: Int) {
    // Implementation for handling interrupt
}
```

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Zyren includes IPC features to enable communication between processes.

```zy
# Initialize IPC
fn init_ipc() {
    // Implementation for initializing IPC
}

# Send message
fn send_message(sender_id: Int, receiver_id: Int, message: String) {
    // Implementation for sending message
}
```

### AI and Networking
Zyren includes features for AI and networking, making it suitable for developing AI systems and networked applications.

```zy
# Initialize the AI framework
fn init_ai() {
    // Implementation for initializing AI
}

# Initialize network
fn init_network() {
    // Implementation for initializing network
}
```

### Web Browser Development
Zyren includes features for developing web browsers, including rendering engines, network protocols, and user interface components.

```zy
# Initialize web browser
fn init_browser() {
    // Implementation for initializing web browser
}

# Render HTML
fn render_html(html: String) {
    // Implementation for rendering HTML
}
```

### Website Creation
Zyren includes features for creating websites, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript support.

```zy
# Initialize web server
fn init_web_server() {
    // Implementation for initializing web server
}

# Serve HTML
fn serve_html(html: String) {
    // Implementation for serving HTML
}
```

## Examples
### Operating System Development
Here is an example of how to use Zyren to develop an operating system.

```zy
# Initialize the kernel
fn kernel_init() {
    // Implementation for initializing the kernel
    init_memory_management();
    init_scheduler();
    init_interrupts();
    init_ipc();
    init_ai();
    init_network();
}

# Main function for the kernel
fn main() -> Int {
    // Implementation for main function
    kernel_init();
    entry_point();
    return 0;
}
```

### Web Browser Development
Here is an example of how to use Zyren to develop a web browser.

```zy
# Initialize web browser
fn init_browser() {
    // Implementation for initializing web browser
}

# Render HTML
fn render_html(html: String) {
    // Implementation for rendering HTML
}
```

### AI System Development
Here is an example of how to use Zyren to develop an AI system.

```zy
# Initialize the AI framework
fn init_ai() {
    // Implementation for initializing AI
}

# Process AI command
fn process_ai_command(command: String) {
    // Implementation for processing AI command
}
```

### Website Creation
Here is an example of how to use Zyren to create a website.

```zy
# Initialize web server
fn init_web_server() {
    // Implementation for initializing web server
}
